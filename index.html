    <h2> What are supplements? </h2>
    <p> Supplements, such as creatine, protein, and preworkout, are substances that gym-goers will consume to better enhance their performance in the gym. Big companies that will make gym supplements are Optimum Nutrition, RYSE, 5% Nutrition, and more. You can find supplements at your local grocery store, but the choice selection is very small. A great place to go to buy supplements would be any commercial gym, One Stop Nutrition, or a gym supplement store.  </p>

    <h2> Where Can I Find Supplements?</h2>
    <p> You can find supplements at your local grocery store, but the choice selection is very small. A great place to go to buy supplements would be any commercial gym, One Stop Nutrition, or a gym supplement store. In One Stop Nutrition, you can get a protein shake that contains creatine, protein, and vitamins. Along with protein shakes, One Stop has a wide variety of supplements, some that are very close to being steriods, which are promtly locked up in a glass wall, needing a key from the front desk to be accessed. </p>

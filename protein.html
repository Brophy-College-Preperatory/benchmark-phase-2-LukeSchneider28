<h2> What is protein?</h2>
<p> Protein powder is a powdery substance that is loaded with protein. It is traditionally consumed through mixing it into water or milk and drinking it. Protein contains amino acids, which are key for healing muscle after a workout. Amino acids cause a muscle to heal, grow, and become stronger.</p>
<h2> How is Protein Powder Made?</h2>
<p> Protein powder that has the label "Whey isolate" is made from a process that is similar to making cheese. According to <a href="https://www.agropur.com/us/news/how-whey-protein-is-made#:~:text=Whey%20is%20derived%20from%20the,filtration%20and%20ion%20exchange%20technology.">Agropur</a>, "Whey is derived from the cheesemaking process. Once the milk passes quality tests, enzymes are added to separate the curd from the liquid whey. The liquid whey is then pasteurized and the protein is concentrated and isolated. The two main methods to achieve this are membrane filtration and ion exchange technology." After separating the whey from the milk, the whey is dried out into a powder, which is then mixed with other flavoring to make the traditional whey protein isolate powder that we see today.</p>
<h2> Where to Buy Protein Powder?</h2>
<p> Not all protein powders are equal. Some of the best protein powders to buy are from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Optimum-Nutrition-Standard-Strawberry-Packaging/dp/B000QSO3FO/ref=asc_df_B000QSO3FO?mcid=ddd837f53996367b95803b24d6be25f2&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693308329636&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7256776982443687175&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9029975&hvtargid=pla-369419796148&psc=1">Optimum Nutrition</a>, <a href="https://5starnutrition.com/products/axe-sledge-farm-fed-100-isolate-v2">Farm Fed Protein</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Body-Fortress-Advanced-Chocolate-Vitamins/dp/B0C6R6VVV7">Body Fortress</a>. These brands are very good because of their high protein count, the quality of their protein, and the other vitamins that the mixture contains.</p>
<h2> Why Not Use Plant Based Protein?</h2>
<p> Plant based protein most likely contains soy, which has been proven to lower testosterone, and cause depression, since it contains estrogen. It is always better to get whey protein because plant based protein has soy, which contains estrogen and lowers testosterone, and makes muscle growth harder.</p>

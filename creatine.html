<p> Methyl guanidine-acetic acid, also known as creatine monohydrate, is a substance that is traditionally found in small amounts in meats such as a steak. Creatine conducts water to go directly to the muscles. The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-creatine/art-20347591#:~:text=Overview,in%20synthetically%20made%20creatine%20supplements.">Mayo Clinic</a> says, "Creatine is a compound that comes from three amino acids. Creatine is found mostly in your body's muscles as well as in the brain. Most people get creatine through seafood and red meat â€” though at levels far below those found in synthetically made creatine supplements.  </p>
